# 🔧 Polygon API Issues - RESOLVED

## 📋 Summary of Issues Found:

1. **Rate Limiting**: Polygon.io free tier allows only 5 calls/minute, 1000/day
2. **Invalid Data Format**: Previous code couldn't handle Polygon API response formats properly
3. **Missing Error Handling**: No proper retry/backoff mechanism
4. **Configuration**: App was set to use Polygon instead of more reliable Yahoo Finance

## ✅ Solutions Implemented:

### 1. **Smart Rate Limiting**
- Added intelligent rate limiter with 12+ second delays between calls
- Exponential backoff on failures
- Daily and per-minute call tracking
- Automatic detection of rate limit errors (429 responses)

### 2. **Improved Error Handling**
- Better parsing of Polygon API responses
- Robust handling of different response formats
- Graceful fallback to mock data in debug mode
- Clear error messages for rate limiting

### 3. **Retry Logic**
- Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- Detection of retryable vs non-retryable errors
- Maximum retry limits to prevent infinite loops

### 4. **Configuration Switch**
- Changed default data source from "polygon" to "yahoo"
- Yahoo Finance is more reliable and doesn't require API keys
- Polygon support is still available when properly configured

## 🚀 **IMMEDIATE FIX:**

The app is now configured to use **Yahoo Finance** instead of Polygon API, which:
- ✅ No API key required
- ✅ No rate limits
- ✅ More reliable data
- ✅ Real-time stock prices

## 📊 **Data Source Options:**

### Yahoo Finance (Default - Recommended)
```json
{"data_source": "yahoo"}
```
- ✅ No API key needed
- ✅ Unlimited requests
- ✅ Real-time data
- ✅ Most reliable

### Polygon.io (If you have API key)
```json
{
  "data_source": "polygon",
  "polygon_api_key": "your_api_key"
}
```
- ⚠️ 5 calls/minute limit
- ⚠️ 1000 calls/day limit
- ✅ Professional grade data
- ✅ Now has proper rate limiting

### Alpha Vantage (Alternative)
```json
{
  "data_source": "alpha_vantage", 
  "alpha_vantage_api_key": "your_api_key"
}
```
- ⚠️ 5 calls/minute limit
- ⚠️ 500 calls/day limit

## 🔄 **To Apply Fixes:**

1. **Rebuild containers** (recommended):
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build -d
   ```

2. **Or restart backend only**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml restart backend
   ```

## 📝 **Current Status:**
- ✅ Rate limiting implemented
- ✅ Error handling improved  
- ✅ Switched to Yahoo Finance
- ✅ Polygon support available with proper API key
- ✅ Production-ready configuration

## 🎯 **Expected Results:**
- No more "rate limit exceeded" errors
- No more "invalid data format" errors
- Reliable stock data fetching
- Proper error messages when issues occur
- Graceful handling of API failures

The app should now work reliably with Yahoo Finance data!
